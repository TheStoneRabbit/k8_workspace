# k8 Workspace

Very simple redis python Flask application.

The app runs on localhost:8000


## To run:

`./start.sh`

**NOTE:** Pressing ctrl-c will stop minikube and delete everything that was generated by this command.

## To reset everything:

`./reset.sh`

This should only be used when you stop the `start.sh` command early or something is wrong with the minikube and kubectl environment.
